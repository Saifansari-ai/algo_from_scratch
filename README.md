# Machine learning algorithms from scratch
- I will impliment machine learning algorithms from scratch without sklearn

# 1. Simple linear Regression
- This model is implemented using ordinary least squares method
- Trained on Salary dataset which has two columns - experience and salary

# 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- Implemented using the ordinary least squares method from scratch.
- Trained a regression model to predict student performance.
- Handled categorical features and ensured proper data preprocessing.
- Evaluated model performance using the RÂ² score.
