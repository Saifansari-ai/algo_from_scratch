# Machine learning algorithms from scratch
- I will impliment machine learning algorithms from scratch without sklearn

# 1. Simple linear Regression
- This model is implemented using ordinary least squares method
- Trained on Salary dataset which has two columns - experience and salary

# 2. Multiple Linear Regression
- Implemented using the ordinary least squares method from scratch.
- Trained a regression model to predict student performance.
- Handled categorical features and ensured proper data preprocessing.
- Evaluated model performance using the R² score.

# 3. Gradient Descent from Scratch for 2 columns 

- Implemented gradient descent from scratch using slope and intercept formulas.
- Developed a `GDRegressor` class for linear regression.
- Trained the model on a salary dataset with 'YearsExperience' and 'Salary' columns.

# 4. Gradient Descent from Scratch for n columns
- Implemented gradient descent from scratch using numpy.
- Developed a `GDRegressor` class for linear regression.
- Loaded the diabetes dataset from sklearn.
- Trained the model and evaluated its performance using the R² score from sklearn.metrics.

# 5. Stochastic Gradient Descent from Scratch
- Implemented stochastic gradient descent from scratch using numpy.
- Developed a `SGDRegressor` class for linear regression.
- Loaded the diabetes dataset from sklearn.
- Trained the model and evaluated its performance using the R² score from sklearn.metrics.

# 6. Mini Batch Gradient Descent from Scratch
- Implemented mini batch gradient descent from scratch using numpy.
- Developed a `MBGDRegressor` class for linear regression.
- Loaded the diabetes dataset from sklearn.
- Trained the model and evaluated its performance using the R² score from sklearn.metrics.
